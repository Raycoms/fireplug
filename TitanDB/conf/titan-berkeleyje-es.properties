# Titan configuration sample: BerkeleyDB JE and embedded Elasticsearch
#
# This file opens a BDB JE instance in the directory
# /path/to/this/file/../db/berkeley.  It also starts an Elasticsearch
# service inside the same JVM running Titan.

# The primary persistence provider used by Titan.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift, cassandra,
# astyanax, embeddedcassandra, hbase, inmemory) or to the full package and
# classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=berkeleyje

# Storage directory for those storage backends that require local storage
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.directory=../db/berkeley

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize Titan's query
# functionality. This setting is optional.  Titan can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends.  Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard index
# backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the full
# package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.
#
# Default:    elasticsearch
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in Titan's
# storage backend.  After starting the database for the first time, this
# file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use Titan's Management System
# to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
index.search.backend=elasticsearch

# Directory to store index data locally
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: MASKABLE
index.search.directory=../db/es

# The Elasticsearch node.client option is set to this boolean value, and
# the Elasticsearch node.data option is set to the negation of this value.
# True creates a thin client which holds no data.  False creates a regular
# Elasticsearch cluster node that may store data.
#
# Default:    true
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in Titan's
# storage backend.  After starting the database for the first time, this
# file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use Titan's Management System
# to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
index.search.elasticsearch.client-only=false

# On the legacy config track, this option chooses between starting a
# TransportClient (false) or a Node with JVM-local transport and local
# data (true).  On the interface config track, this option is considered
# by (but optional for) the Node client and ignored by the
# TransportClient.  See the manual for more information about ES config
# tracks.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
