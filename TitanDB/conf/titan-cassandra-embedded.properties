# Titan configuration sample: embedded Cassandra
#
# This file starts a Cassandra daemon in the same JVM as Titan and
# talks to it using direct Java method calls.
#
# The embedded Cassandra backend is not officially publicly supported.
# The cassandrathrift and astyanax backends -- which connect to
# Cassandra over its Thrift API -- are supported alternatives.w

# The primary persistence provider used by Titan.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift, cassandra,
# astyanax, embeddedcassandra, hbase, inmemory) or to the full package and
# classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL

# Path to a configuration file for those storage backends which
# require/support a single separate config file.

# Whether to enable Titan's database-level cache, which is shared across
# all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by holding
# hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood of
# reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.

# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.

# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).
