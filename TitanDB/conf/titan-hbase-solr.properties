# Titan configuration sample: HBase and Elasticsearch
#
# This file connects to HBase using a Zookeeper quorum
# (storage.hostname) consisting solely of localhost.  It also 
# connects to Solr running on localhost using Solr's HTTP API.
# Zookeeper, the HBase services, and Solr must already be 
# running and available before starting Titan with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by Titan.  This is required.  It
# should be set one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift, cassandra,
# astyanax, embeddedcassandra, hbase, inmemory) or to the full package and
# classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=hbase

# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.
#
# Default:    127.0.0.1
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.hostname=127.0.0.1

# Whether to enable Titan's database-level cache, which is shared across
# all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by holding
# hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood of
# reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE
cache.db-cache = true

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.
#
# Default:    50
# Data Type:  Integer
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in Titan's
# storage backend.  After starting the database for the first time, this
# file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use Titan's Management System
# to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
cache.db-cache-clean-wait = 20

# Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the
# database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even
# if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache
# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).
#
# Default:    10000
# Data Type:  Long
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in Titan's

cache.db-cache-time = 180000

# Size of Titan's database level cache.  Values between 0 and 1 are
# interpreted as a percentage of VM heap, while larger values are
# interpreted as an absolute size in bytes.
#
# Default:    0.3
# Data Type:  Double
# Mutability: MASKABLE
cache.db-cache-size = 0.5

# Configure a Solr backend named "search" at localhost:8983
# and path prefix /solr/titan.solr1.
# The collection must already exist -- see the manual for info.

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize Titan's query
# functionality. This setting is optional.  Titan can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends.  Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of Titan's built-in shorthand names for its standard index
# backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the full
# package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.

# Default:    elasticsearch

index.search.backend=solr

# The operation mode for Solr which is either via HTTP (`http`) or using
# SolrCloud (`cloud`)
